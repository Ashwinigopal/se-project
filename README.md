SE-Project, C-Sharper
=====================
Let's try to use Github for this project to see if it makes making changes more simple. In theory, it should.

About the project
-----------------
This project is for a class called 'Software Engineering'. For this assignment we (a team of 6 students from the Leiden University) need to create software for use in a programming class. Students using this software can complete several programming assignments in the language C#. The assignments are given by the teacher. The students should be able to write code in our program, maybe test it, save it, edit it and when they are finally done, they should be able to mark the assignment as 'Ready to check' and the lecturer should be able to check the students' solutions and give them feedback.
Some additional features will be mentioned later.

We use the 'Scrum'-method for this software and we use the Scrumwise software to maintain a digital copy of the Scrumboard.
